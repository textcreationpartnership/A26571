         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GReat is the hand of the Lord, (O King) in thy coming ſo far into Power again; and conſider the cauſe of it (in the fear of the Lord) and thou wilt find, that it is, becauſe they unto whom God gave ſuch power over thee, were not faithfull unto God, but grieved the Spirit of the Lord with their hypocriſie from day to day, talking for Liberty, but behold they brought forth oppreſſion, and ſo became wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then thoſe that went before them, who did not profeſs ſo much for liberty in their words, but performed better <hi>things</hi> in their actions. Therefore let no man deceive thee, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading thee that theſe things are thus brought to paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdom was thy own proper right, and becauſe it was with-held from thee contrary to all right, or, becauſe thoſe called <hi>Royalists</hi> are much more righteous than thoſe, who are now fallen under thee; For I plainly declare unto thee, that this Kingdom, and all the Kingdoms of the Earth, are properly the Lords, &amp; that he may, and doth give them unto whomſoever he pleaſeth; and whenſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, he may take them away again, and give them unto others. As to thy Government, I do declare in the truth and preſence of the Lord, many thouſands being of the ſame mind with me that it is not for the name, that may be put upon a Government, that we either ſtand for or againſt; but it is a righteous Government (according to the higher power, which is according to that of God in every mans <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>) which we ſtand for, and earneſtly deſire after, both in things appertaining to God and Man; And we, for our ſelves deſire no greater liberty; either in things religious, or in things civil betwixt man and man, than we deſire all others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31299:4"/>might enjoy; and if ſuch a Government as this be ſet up, we ſhall willingly ſubmit unto Righteouſneſs from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour, as our duty; and yield all due lawfull obedience unto him and his Commands, by labouring in the power of the Lord, to bring down and to keep under the evil luſt in people, which is the cauſe of all Wars and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and tranſgreſſion: And as much as in us lies, we ſhall endeavour to live peaceably with all men, and perſwade others unto the ſame; and ſo, by a godly converſation, we ſhall be patterns unto others, and this will be an adorning of good Government and good Governours, and a help unto them, and this we reſolve in the ſtrength of the Lord to do.</p>
